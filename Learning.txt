Going over what I've done.

From top to bottom in the file order.

Client/Components/App.tsx
Imported things, 

made a function  to show our app page, with our useQuery,
- wich is kinda like a state of the page.
in our case we used "data, isPending, isError, and error"
not sure how error works but it magically explains what went wrong when somtign does go wrong.
then used a query key, don't know what they do in the function but it doesn't work without them.

make a async function inside that function
